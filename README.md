# HR-Layered-Program
Layered Program in java

In this Project I created a layered Program of Using Three Layers
>PRESENTATION LAYER,
>BUSINESS LAYER,
>DATA LAYER

At Data Layer Data is collected and put it into Database using MySQL by SQL Queries.
At Business Layer various Data Structure is maintained for Fast retrieval of Data.
Presentation Layer is used to present the Application UI to the User.

Later, the whole Application is converted into Network Application.
